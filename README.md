## Description

Nullpo is a simple drag-and-drop file uploader for OS X that allows to upload files to various "Pomf-clones". It also keeps a history of files uploaded and estimates the time of removal for uploads.

## Installation

Pre-built application bundles can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/Hamuko/Nullpo/releases) page.

If you wish to compile Nullpo by yourself, install the dependencies with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) by running `carthage bootstrap` in the project directory.
